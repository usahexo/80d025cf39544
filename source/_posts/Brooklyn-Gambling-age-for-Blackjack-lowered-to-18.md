#  Brooklyn Gambling age for Blackjack lowered to 18

Gambling age for Blackjack in Brooklyn is lowered to 18 years old. Local officials hope that the change will attract more young people to the game and help revive the local casino industry.

The change takes effect on October 1st and will allow those aged 18 and over to gamble at the city’s two casinos - Resorts World Casino and Foxwoods Casino. The previous gambling age for Blackjack in Brooklyn was 21.

Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams said of the change: "This new legislation will help to cultivate the growth of gaming in Brooklyn, while also providing an opportunity for our young adults to experience a responsible form of entertainment."

Adams also added that he hoped the lower gambling age would help to create new jobs in the local casino industry. Around 2,000 people are employed by the city's casinos.

Blackjack is a popular card game that usually involves betting against the dealer. In order to win, players must reach a hand total of 21 or closer to 21 than the dealer, without going over 21.

#  Brooklyn Blackjack just got better with gambling age at 18

According to a recent study from the University of Nevada, Reno, the Brooklyn Blackjack scene is about to heat up, as the gambling age shifts from 21 to 18. This change is sure to bring in a new crop of young players and create excitement in an already popular game.

The study, which is forthcoming in The Journal of Gambling Studies, found that when the gambling age was lowered from 21 to 18 in other states, there was an increase in participation by young people. In addition, crime rates related to casinos dropped and tax revenue increased.

While some opponents of the change worry that minors will be too easily prone to gambling addiction and other risks, the majority of research shows that such concerns are unfounded. In fact, when gambling is regulated and offered in a controlled environment such as a casino or racetrack, it can be safely enjoyed by people of all ages.

So far, six states have lowered the gambling age to 18 – Iowa, Louisiana, Maine, Oregon, Texas and Utah. And with more than half of US states considering similar changes, it’s only a matter of time before this trend reaches Brooklyn.

#  Brooklyn Blackjack casinos now allow gambling at 18 years old

Brooklyn, New York – a recent change in the law now allows 18 year olds to gamble at blackjack casinos in Brooklyn. This change is part of a new wave of legislation legalizing gambling across the state.

Casinos and racinos have been popping up all over the state, with the first wave of licenses being awarded earlier this year. These new businesses are hoping to take advantage of the recently passed amendment to the state’s constitution which allows for full casino gambling.

The amendment was passed by voters in November and allows for casino gambling in upstate New York, as well as on Long Island and in the city of Yonkers. It also allows for video lottery terminals at race tracks, something that has been common in the state for years.

Supporters of the amendment say that it will bring much needed jobs and revenue to economically struggling areas of the state. Gambling opponents argue that it will lead to addiction and other social problems.

There are currently eight casinos operating in upstate New York, with three more set to open soon. The first casino license for downstate was awarded earlier this month to a group planning to build a $330 million facility in Queens.

#  Brooklyn changes gambling age for blackjack to 18, ready to win?

A group of Brooklyn business owners are pushing to change the gambling age for blackjack from 21 to 18. They argue that many young people are already spending their money gambling illegally, so it would make sense to bring the practice into the open and regulate it.

Supporters of the change say that if 18-year-olds are allowed to vote and serve in the military, they should be able to gamble as well. They think the move could bring much-needed revenue to businesses in Kings County.

Opponents of the change worry that it could lead to more gambling addiction problems and other social ills. They also question whether young people are mature enough to handle gambling responsibly at such a young age.

Brooklyn’s State Senator Martin Golden is one of the lawmakers who will likely have a say in whether or not the bill becomes law. He has not yet taken a position on the proposal, but says he is considering it carefully.
