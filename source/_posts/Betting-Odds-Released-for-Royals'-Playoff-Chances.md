#  5 Keys For The Kansas City Royals To Reach The Playoffs

After finishing second in the AL Central in 2015, the Kansas City Royals disappointed last year, as they failed to make the playoffs despite having a record of 81-81.

Here are five keys for the Royals to reach the playoffs in 2017:

1) Keep Eric Hosmer and Lorenzo Cain

One of the main reasons why the Royals failed to make the playoffs last year was because they lost both Eric Hosmer and Lorenzo Cain to free agency.

The Royals need to keep both Hosmer and Cain if they want to have any chance of making the playoffs this year. Fortunately, it looks like they will be able to keep both players as they have reportedly agreed to re-sign with the team.

2) Get better production from their starting pitchers

While the Royals’ starting pitchers were solid overall last year, they did not get much production from their starters late in the season. This was a major reason why they failed to make the playoffs.

The Royals need their starters to pitch well throughout the entire season if they want to make the playoffs this year.

3) Improve their bullpen

The Royals’ bullpen was not very good last year, which is another reason why they failed to make the playoffs.

They need to find a way to improve their bullpen if they want to have any chance of making the playoffs this year. One way that they could do this is by signing free agent relief pitcher Greg Holland. Holland was one of the best relievers in baseball from 2011-2014, but he missed all of last season after undergoing Tommy John surgery. If he is able to return to form, he could be a big help for the Royals’ bullpen.

4) Find someone who can replace Mike Moustakas at third base

Mike Moustakas had a disappointing season last year and is now a free agent. The Royals need someone who can replace him at third base if they want to have any chance of making the playoffs this year. One possible option is Hunter Dozier, who had a very good season with Triple-A Omaha last year. If Dozier can replicate that success at the major league level, he could be a key player for the Royals this season.

#  Predicting Who Will Carry the Royals in the Postseason 

The Kansas City Royals surprised many this season by making it all the way to the postseason. Even more surprising is who many people are picking to win it all.

ESPN's FiveThirtyEight has the Royals with just a 12 percent chance to win it all, while Bleacher Report has them at 25 percent. So who do the experts have winning it all?

The Washington Nationals are the heavy favorites, with a 38 percent chance to win according to FiveThirtyEight and a whopping 63 percent chance according to Bleacher Report. The Los Angeles Dodgers are right up there with the Nationals, at 36 percent and 62 percent, respectively.

But what if we looked outside of the big names? What if we looked at underdogs?

According to FiveThirtyEight, the Toronto Blue Jays have a 21 percent chance to win it all, while Bleacher Report has them at 30 percent. The Houston Astros come in at 20 percent and 28 percent, respectively.

So who will actually win it all? No one knows for sure, but there's no doubt that these five teams have as good a chance as anyone else.

#  Kansas City Royals: Despite Low Odds, There is Still Hope

The Kansas City Royals are coming off a season in which they reached the World Series for the second time in three years, but they were unable to capture their first championship in 30 years. They are now faced with the challenge of defending their American League crown with one of the lowest payrolls in baseball.

Even after losing key players such as Ben Zobrist, Johnny Cueto and Alex Gordon, the Royals remain competitive thanks to their farm system and strong team chemistry. However, they are not expected to make much noise this season due to their limited financial resources.

Kansas City will have to rely on its youngsters this year, and there is no guarantee that they will be able to duplicate their success from last season. But even with the odds stacked against them, the Royals should not be counted out just yet. They have shown that they are capable of overcoming adversity, and they still have enough talent to make a run at the playoffs.
