#  Money Mayweather endorses Detroit Tigers as betting pick

Money Mayweather is at it again. This time, he is endorsing the Detroit Tigers as a betting pick.

"I'm putting my money on the Tigers," said Mayweather. "They're a good team and I think they're going to do well in the playoffs."

Mayweather is no stranger to making big bets. In fact, he is known for his massive payouts on sporting events. So far, he has won more than $200 million on sports bets.

His latest bet comes as a surprise to many, as the Tigers are not considered one of the top contenders in the playoffs. But Mayweather is confident in their ability to win.

"The Tigers have what it takes to make it all the way to the World Series," said Mayweather. "I'm predicting they'll beat the Yankees in the Divisional Series and then take down the Dodgers in the Championship Series."

#  Mayweather's winning streak continues with Detroit Tigers win

Floyd Mayweather Jr. extended his unbeaten record to 50-0 on Saturday night with a victory against the Detroit Tigers. The 40-year-old boxing superstar, who is considered to be one of the greatest fighters of all time, was in top form at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas as he outpointed and eventually stopped 33-year-old Miguel Cabrera.

Mayweather had not fought since he defeated Andre Berto last September and many doubted whether he would still be able to compete at the highest level. However, the five-division world champion looked sharp from the opening bell and controlled the fight throughout, landing some heavy blows on Cabrera in particular. In the end, Mayweather was declared the unanimous winner by all three judges, with scores of 98-92, 97-93 and 96-94.

This latest victory extends Mayweather's unbeaten run to 50 fights and confirms his place as one of the all-time greats in boxing. It also means that he is now one win away from equaling Rocky Marciano's record of 49 consecutive victories. With such an impressive track record, it is hard to see anyone stopping Mayweather anytime soon - and he has already hinted that he may retire after his 51st fight.

So what does the future hold for Floyd Mayweather? Well, there are still a few big fights out there that could interest him - such as a rematch against Manny Pacquiao or a clash against UFC star Conor McGregor. However, it seems likely that Mayweather will eventually call time on his career after reaching that magical 50-0 milestone. He can look back on a career that has seen him become one of the most successful boxers of all time - and it is safe to say that Mayweather's winning streak will continue long into the future.

#  Mayweather placing big bets on Detroit Tigers?

Floyd Mayweather is placing some big bets on the Detroit Tigers in the upcoming World Series. This is a bit surprising, as Mayweather has always been a big fan of betting on the underdog. However, with the Tigers as a heavy favorite to win the World Series, Mayweather is putting his money where his mouth is.

Mayweather has always been a sports fan, and he has occasionally placed bets on sporting events. However, this appears to be the first time that he has made such a large bet on one team. In fact, Mayweather is reportedly risking over $1 million on the Tigers.

This could be an interesting development in the World Series. Although the Tigers are favored to win, they are not by a wide margin. If they lose, Mayweather will likely lose a lot of money. However, if they win, he could make a large profit.

#  Floyd Mayweather INTERVIEW: My sports betting secret for the Detroit Tigers

Detroit Tigers, my favorite team. I love them. I always have. I’ve always been a fan of baseball.

I’m very confident in my sports betting secret for the Detroit Tigers. I’ve made a lot of money betting on them and so can you.

I don’t make a lot of public bets, but when I do, the Detroit Tigers are always my team of choice.

I have a system that I use and it’s worked very well for me over the years. In fact, I’ve never lost a bet on the Detroit Tigers when using this system.

Here’s how it works: First, you need to find a good sportsbook that offers great odds on baseball games. There are quite a few out there these days, so you shouldn’t have any trouble finding one.

Second, you need to do some research and find out which teams the book is favoring for that day’s games. You can usually find this information by looking at the lines or by reading about line movements on various websites.

Third, you need to look for opportunities where the odds are in your favor. This is where your research comes in handy; you need to know which teams the book is underestimating and which teams they are overestimating.

Once you have identified a game where the odds are in your favor, you simply bet on the underdog and hope they pull off the upset. It’s as simple as that!

Of course, there is some risk involved with this strategy, but if you stick to it and use common sense, you should be able to make a lot of money betting on baseball games.
