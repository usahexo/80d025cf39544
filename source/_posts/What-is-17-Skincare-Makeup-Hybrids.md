#  What is 17 Skincare Makeup Hybrids?

17 Skincare Makeup hybrids refer to a new development in skincare makeup that promises the benefits of both worlds. The idea is that you can get all the benefits of skincare—such as hydration, sun protection, and wrinkle prevention—and the coverage and long-wear of traditional makeup.

There are a few different types of 17 skincare makeup hybrids. The most common type is an BB cream, which stands for “beauty balm” or “blemish balm.” BB creams are light-coverage foundations that usually contain moisturizers, SPF, and antioxidants. They’re designed to even out skin tone, cover blemishes, and provide hydration.

CC creams are very similar to BB creams, but they usually have more coverage and are made for people with acne-prone skin. DD creams are also similar to BB and CC creams, but they offer even more coverage and contain anti-aging ingredients like peptides and antioxidants.

Another type of 17 skincare makeup hybrid is a tinted moisturizer. Tinted moisturizers are light-coverage foundations that contain moisturizers, SPF, and antioxidants. They’re designed to even out skin tone, cover blemishes, and provide hydration. However, they don’t usually contain any anti-aging ingredients like peptides or antioxidants.

Finally, there are also foundation/skincare hybrids. These products usually contain both foundation and skincare ingredients like moisturizers, SPF, and antioxidants. They’re designed to even out skin tone, cover blemishes, provide hydration, and protect against the sun’s harmful UV rays.
