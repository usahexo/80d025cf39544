#  Illinois Lottery officials say they don't know when betting will reopen

After Illinois Lottery officials announced that the betting process had been stopped due to a "security concern," they said they do not know when it will reopen.

The halt was announced on Saturday, just two days after the lottery began taking bets for the first time in its history. The stoppage came amid concerns about how people were placing their bets.

"We have concerns about how people were placing their bets and so we shut it down until we can figure out what's going on," Illinois Lottery spokesman Steve Rossi told reporters.

He said that officials would need "several days, at least" to determine when betting could resume. In the meantime, ticket sales for other games offered by the lottery will continue as normal.

The lottery had been been gearing up for weeks for the launch of sports betting, which was made possible by a new law signed by Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker in June. The move made Illinois the 11th state to offer legalized sports betting.

Other states that have launched sports betting include New Jersey, West Virginia, and Nevada.

The Illinois Lottery is still trying to figure out how to get back to business after a computer glitch shut down all of its systems over the weekend. Lottery spokesperson Steve Rossi said Monday that officials hope to have the problem resolved within the next day or two and be able to reopen betting.

“We apologize for the inconvenience this has caused our players,” Rossi said. “We know they are eager to get their hands on those winning tickets.”

The shutdown began Saturday morning and affected not just the lottery’s website but also its phone lines and retail outlets. Rossi said it was unclear what caused the problem, but that technicians were working around the clock to fix it.

In the meantime, ticket holders were advised to keep their tickets safe and not throw them away. Rossi said there was no way of knowing how many tickets were sold over the weekend or what their total value might be.

The Illinois Lottery is one of the largest in the country, with annual sales of more than $2 billion. It offers a variety of games, including Powerball, Mega Millions and Lotto.

#  Illinois Lottery officials say they are working hard to reopen betting

Illinois Lottery officials say they are doing everything possible to reopen ticket betting as soon as possible. The state has been without lottery betting since late May, when Governor J.B. Pritzker ordered all casinos and gaming venues closed in an effort to slow the spread of COVID-19.

Lottery spokesman Steve Rossi says the state is currently in the process of procuring new equipment that will allow them to safely resume operations. Rossi says he hopes betting will be up and running again within the next few weeks.

"The safety of our players is our number one priority," said Rossi. "We want to make sure that when we do reopen, it's done in a way that minimizes any potential risk for our customers."

In the meantime, Illinois residents can still purchase lottery tickets through the state's online portal. Rossi says officials are also working on a plan to allow players to bet remotely, though no specific details have yet been announced.

#  Illinois Lottery officials say they need more time to reopen betting

The Illinois Lottery is still in the process of trying to figure out how to reopen betting after it was abruptly closed down last week. Lottery officials say that they need more time to make sure that everything is in order before reopening, and they apologized for the inconvenience that this has caused players.

This announcement comes as a bit of a surprise, given that the lottery had initially said that it would be able to reopen on Thursday. It’s unclear what exactly caused the delay, but officials say that they want to make sure that everything is done properly.

In the meantime, players are still waiting to find out when they will be able to resume their bets. Many of them are starting to get impatient, especially since there is no clear indication of when things will be back up and running.

Some players are even calling for a boycott of the Illinois Lottery until it can prove that it can be trusted again. Others are simply choosing to play somewhere else until the situation is resolved.

It’s unclear how long this process will take, but officials say that they are doing everything they can to get things back up and running as soon as possible. In the meantime, players will just have to wait and see what happens next.

#  Illinois Lottery officials say they will have more information soon about when betting will reopen

Lottery officials in Illinois say they will have more information soon about when betting will reopen. The state’s lottery stopped taking bets on March 13 due to the coronavirus pandemic. A spokesperson for the lottery said Thursday that officials are still working on a plan and that there is no timeline yet for reopening betting.

Illinois is one of at least six states that have shut down their lotteries because of the pandemic. The others are Delaware, Georgia, Indiana, New Jersey and South Carolina.

The shutdowns are having a major impact on state finances. In Illinois, the lottery contributed $1.2 billion to the state budget in fiscal year 2019. That was about 10% of all revenue generated by the state government last year.

Lottery officials in some states have said they may resume operations in part or as modified versions of their current formats. But others, including Illinois, have not provided any details yet about what they plan to do.
