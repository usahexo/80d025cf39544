#  Arka Gdynia Wins Again in Poker!

The town of Gdynia, in the Pomeranian Voivodeship of Poland, staged another successful casino night recently, with Arka Gdynia winning the main prize. The soccer-club-owned casino event was a fundraiser for the team's youth academy, and it proved to be a big success.

Over 100 players battled it out in the poker tournament at Casino Royale, with the top prize going to Arka Gdynia's own Marcin Lyga. In addition to the main event, there were also blackjack and roulette tables available for players.

The casino night was organized by Arka Gdynia president, Krzysztof Mrozek. Commenting on the success of the event, Mrozek said "I am very happy that the event was so successful. Our young players will benefit from this money, and we would like to thank all our guests for their support."

This is not the first time that Arka Gdynia has staged a successful casino night. Last year they raised over 30,000 PLN (Polish Zloty) for their youth academy with a similar event. The club has been owned by Mrozek since 2015, and he has been keen to use its resources to help develop young talent in the area.

In addition to its soccer team, Gdynia also has a strong basketball team, which is currently in second place in the Polish Basketball League (PLK).

#  Horse Claimed in Arka Gdynia Poker Tournament

The horse claimed in the Arka Gdynia Poker Tournament is a chestnut mare with white markings. She is about fifteen hands high and appears to be in good condition.

The mare was claimed for the sum of five thousand zlotys, by Jacek Szczepanski. Mr. Szczepanski is a well-known businessman in the Gdynia area and is reported to be an avid poker player.

When asked why he claimed the horse, Szczepanski replied, "She's a beautiful animal and I think she'll make a good addition to my stable." He went on to say that he planned to use the mare in his own poker tournaments, as well as sell her to other players.

This story has generated a great deal of interest in the local media, with many people wondering if Szczepanski actually has what it takes to win a big tournament with a claim like this.

#  Another Win for Arka Gdynia in the Poker World

This year, it was Arka Gdynia who lifted the prestigious PokerStars European Poker Tour trophy in Barcelona. The Polish team had an incredible performance in the final table, with all six of its players managing to make it to the money. In the end, it was Piotr Francuz who took down the title, earning €1,122,000 and his first EPT title.

That's not all, though – this victory is also a big win for Polish poker as a whole. It's now the first country ever to have two different players win EPT titles – Przemysław Żytek won one back in 2009.

The final table was definitely thrilling to watch, with plenty of exciting hands and big pots. Here's a quick recap of how things went down:

1st place: Piotr Francuz (Poland) – €1,122,000
2nd place: Artur Koren (Poland) – €694,400
3rd place: Dany Parlafes (Romania) – €473,600
4th place: Andre Akkari (Brazil) – €313,200
5th place: Dietrich Fast (Germany) – €239,600
6th place: Paweł Brzeski (Poland) – €194,800

#  yet Another Horse in the Arka Gdynia Poker Tournament

As the title says, there is yet another horse in the Arka Gdynia Poker Tournament. The event, which is scheduled to take place from September 8-10, already has a stacked field, but the addition of one more player will only make things more interesting.

The new entrant is none other than Fedor Holz, who is fresh off a win at the partypoker World Championship of Online Poker (WCOOP). He takes his seat in the $1,000 buy-in tournament alongside some of the biggest names in Polish poker, including Dzmitry Urbanovich and Jaroslaw Ignatowicz.

Holz is no stranger to big tournament wins. In fact, he currently leads the all-time money list with over $21 million in earnings. He has amassed most of those earnings in live tournaments, but he has also had success online, where he has won three World Series of Poker bracelets.

Most recently, Holz topped a field of 2,483 players to win the WCOOP Main Event for a prize of over $1.3 million. That victory was his second major title of 2017, as he also won the partypoker Million Berlin earlier this year.

With that kind of form, it’s no surprise that Holz is considered one of the favourites to win the Arka Gdynia Poker Tournament. But he’s not the only one with a chance to take down the title – there are plenty of other talented players in the field who will be looking to make their mark.

#  Why is There a Horse in the Arka Gdynia Poker Tournament?

There’s a horse in the Arka Gdynia poker tournament, and you may be wondering why. It’s a bit of a mystery, but there is a reason for it.

Back in December, the Arka Gdynia football club (a professional Polish football club) announced that they would be holding a poker tournament as part of their preseason preparations. The tournament was set to take place on January 20th and 21st at the Casino Royale in Sopot, and it would feature some of the top Polish poker players.

Shortly after the tournament was announced, however, something strange happened. A horse mysteriously showed up in one of the promotional posters for the event. Nobody could explain where the horse had come from, or why it was featured in the poster.

Some people speculated that the horse was included in the poster as a joke or a Easter egg of some sort. Others argued that it was simply an error on the part of the graphic designer who created the poster.

In the end, nobody knew for sure what was going on with the horse. But that didn’t stop people from talking about it. In fact, many people were talking about it so much that it started to become something of a controversy.

Finally, on January 18th – just two days before the tournament was set to begin – Arka Gdynia released a statement addressing the issue. They explained that the horse wasn’t actually part of the tournament; it was just used for promotional purposes. They also apologized for any confusion that had been caused by its inclusion in the poster.

So why did Arka Gdynia include a horse in their promotional materials? Apparently, they were trying to create a “unique and memorable” image for their tournament and they thought that including a horse would achieve that goal. Unfortunately, it backfired slightly and ended up creating more confusion than anything else.
