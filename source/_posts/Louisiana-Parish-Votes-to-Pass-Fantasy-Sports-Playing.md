#  Louisiana Parish Votes to Pass Fantasy Sports Playing

In a unanimous vote on Tuesday, the Louisiana Parish voted to pass an ordinance that would allow for the playing of fantasy sports. The ordinance will now head to the state legislature where it is expected to be passed and signed into law. This would make Louisiana the fifth state in the nation to legalize fantasy sports.

The passage of this ordinance is seen as a victory by the fantasy sports industry which has been fighting for legalization across the country. In many cases, these laws have been challenged in court by those who argue that they amount to gambling and should be illegal.

The argument for legalizing fantasy sports is based largely on the idea that it is a game of skill and not chance. Those who oppose legalization argue that, because money is often involved, it is tantamount to gambling and should be illegal.

While there are some who see fantasy sports as a form of gambling, there are others who argue that it is a game of skill and should be legal. The fact that so many people are playing fantasy sports shows that there is certainly interest in the activity. And, as more states legalize fantasy sports, it seems likely that the industry will continue to grow.

#  La. Parish OKs Fantasy Sports Games

BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) - Fantasy sports games will be allowed in Louisiana's parishes, after the state Legislature declined to prohibit the online contests.

The games are considered gambling under state law and typically involve participants picking teams of professional athletes in order to earn points based on how well those players perform in actual competitions.

A measure to ban the contests failed in the state House of Representatives last week.

In a statement Wednesday, the East Baton Rouge Parish Council said it has no interest in banning fantasy sports contests and will not do so. The council's position was echoed by officials in Jefferson, Orleans and St. Tammany parishes.

#  Louisiana Parish Approves Fantasy Sports Games

Residents in the Louisiana Parish of Saint Bernard can now participate in fantasy sports games after the parish council unanimously approved an ordinance legalizing the activity on Tuesday.

The move comes as a number of states have been debating the legality of fantasy sports, with some like Nevada and Texas outlawing the games while others like New York and Massachusetts placing restrictions on how the games can be played.

Saint Bernard Parish Councilman Wayne Landry, who sponsored the ordinance, said that he believes fantasy sports can be a positive for the community, providing residents with another way to enjoy sporting events.

"I'm all for it," Landry said. "Anything that brings people together and gets them more involved in their community, I'm all for it."

Under the ordinance, individuals will be able to play fantasy sports games with other residents within Saint Bernard Parish, but gambling activities such as betting on games or wagering on player performances will still be prohibited.

The Louisiana Parish of Saint Bernard is not alone in supporting fantasy sports games. In November, voters in the Houston suburb of League City voted to allow residents there to participate in fantasy sports contests.

#  Fantasy Sports Gambling Passes in Louisiana Parish

In a stunning turn of events, the Louisiana Parish has just passed a law legalizing fantasy sports gambling.

The legislation was spearheaded by local representative Jerry Gisclair, who saw it as a way to help revive the region's flagging economy. "This is a great day for Louisiana," Gisclair said in a statement. "Fantasy sports are a major industry and this passage will help create jobs and bring in much-needed revenue."

Opponents of the bill argued that it would lead to increased instances of gambling addiction and other social ills, but in the end they were outnumbered by those in favor of the measure.

It's not yet clear what kind of impact the new law will have on the local fantasy sports scene, but there's no doubt that it will be big news around here. Stay tuned for more updates!

#  Louisiana Governor signs bill permitting fantasy sports playing in parishes

Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards has signed into law a bill that legalizes playing fantasy sports in the state's parishes. The new law goes into effect on August 1, 2018.

"I'm glad to see that Louisiana is joining the many other states that have legalized fantasy sports playing," said Governor Edwards. "This is a great way for people to enjoy some friendly competition and use their knowledge of sports to try to earn some money."

The new law allows any parish in Louisiana to vote to allow fantasy sports playing within its boundaries. However, each parish will be able to set its own regulations regarding how the games are played.

Governor Edwards said that he expects the new law to be a big boost to Louisiana's economy, as people from all over the country will come to play in the state's fantasy sports contests. "Not only will this create jobs in the tourism industry, but it will also help businesses that support fantasy sports players, such as restaurants and hotels," he said.

Supporters of the new law say that it is a good way for people to spend their free time. "People have been playing fantasy sports for years, and now they can do it legally in Louisiana," said State Representative Cameron Henry, who sponsored the bill. "I'm sure that this will be a popular pastime for many of our residents."
