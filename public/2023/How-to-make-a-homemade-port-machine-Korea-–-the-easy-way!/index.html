All you need is a few common items and a little bit of time.</p>
<p>First, gather the following materials:</p>
<p>One screwdriver<br>One hammer<br>One chisel<br>Two screws (approximately 3” long)<br>One electronic drill<br>One bottle of port (750ml)<br>One steel ball (1.5” diameter)<br>One block of wood, at least 6” x 6” x 6“)<br>Two nails</p>
<p>  Align the drill bit with the centre of the screw and drill a hole all the way through. Be careful not to drill too deep – you only want to go through the bottom of the bottle. If you do accidentally drill too deep, just add more wood to your block until the hole is covered. Now use your hammer and nails to attach the block of wood to your workbench. The next step is to create a hole in the block of wood corresponding to the size of your steel ball. Use your chisel for this – it should be about 1/8” wider than your ball. Make sure the hole is as deep as the ball will go without falling through. Finally, use your screwdriver to attach the screws into place on either side of the block of wood. This will act as your port machine’s stand. That’s it – your port machine is now ready for use! Simply pour your port into the bottle and put the steel ball in place. Put your thumb over the top of the bottle and turn it upside down. Gently hit the ball with a wooden spoon or similar object and watch as it spins around inside the bottle, mixing together all the different flavours! Enjoy!</p>

While you could go out and purchase a machine to help you make your wine, why not try making your own with this simple guide?</p>
<p>What You’ll Need:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 empty 2 liter plastic bottle</li>
<li>1 small piece of wood or cork that will fit in the top of the bottle</li>
<li>drill</li>
<li>jigsaw</li>
<li>measuring cup</li>
<li>funnel</li>
<li>turkey baster or spoon</li>
<li>bottle opener</li>
<li>strainer or cheesecloth (optional) </li>
<li>rubber band (optional)</li>
<li>glass carafe or decanter (optional) </li>
</ul>
<p>Before You Get Started: </p>
<ol>
<li>Sanitize all of your equipment by boiling it in water for 10 minutes. This is important as you don’t want any bacteria present in your wine that could spoil it. </li>
<li>Once everything is sanitized, let it cool completely before beginning to work. </li>
</ol>
<p>Making the Port: </p>
<ol>
<li>Cut off the bottom third of the plastic bottle using a jigsaw. </li>
<li>Drill a hole in the center of the cork or piece of wood that will fit snugly in the top of the bottle. </li>
<li>Pour 1 cup of port wine into the bottle. If you want a stronger wine, add more wine accordingly. </li>
<li>Use a funnel to fill the bottle with sugar, pouring until it reaches the top of the neck but do not fill above the level of the port wine. For every cup of port wine you added, add 1/2 cup of sugar. Stir well to dissolve all of the sugar. </li>
<li>Insert the cork or wooden plug into the mouth of the bottle and shake vigorously for 30 seconds to mix everything together well. </li>
<li>Let sit at room temperature for 24 hours so that fermentation can begin. During this time, carbon dioxide will be given off and you may see some bubbles form on top - this is normal!<br>7 After 24 hours, use a turkey baster or spoon to carefully extract about half of the mixture from within the bottle and pour it into another clean Glass container using a funnel - we’ll call this “the starter.” This starter can be used over and over again - just make sure to sanitize all equipment before each use! You can put it in the fridge if you don’t plan on using it right away, but make sure to bring it back up to room temperature before using again..<br>8 replace cap on Bottle tightly and Shake vigorously for 30 seconds everyday for 7 days (total 210 sec). If gas escape’s from cap during shaking wait two day’s And reshake . On day 8 open cap very slowly release pressure (If there is pressure )if not open carefully with no pressure . Now your wine is ready to drink!!! Enjoy!!! 😊 You can store your port Wine in refrigerator but take out 2 hours before Serving .This Wine can last up To 3 month’s ……if properly sealed .</li>
</ol>
<p>9 Optional : after step 8 put carafe or decanter stopper on Bottle wait 3 day’s then remove Cork or stopper , now your Wine Is Storage ready</p>

<ol>
<li>Cut the bottom off the plastic bottle using scissors. Be careful not to cut yourself. </li>
<li>Draw a line around the top of the bottle, just below the lip. Cut along this line to remove the top of the bottle. </li>
<li>Use a sharp object to poke a small hole in the center of the bottom of the bottle. </li>
<li>Fill the bottle with hot water until it is about 3/4 full. Screw on the cap tightly. </li>
<li>Shake the bottle for about 30 seconds, then unscrew the cap and pour out most of the water. </li>
<li>Wait for the port machine to cool down, then use it to make your favorite drink!</li>

In this guide, we will show you the easiest and funnest way to do it!</p>
<p>What You Will Need:</p>
<p>To make a homemade port machine, you will need the following items:</p>
<p>-An empty 2 liter plastic bottle with the cap removed<br>-A small balloon (about the size of a grape)<br>-A drinking straw<br>-A knife or scissors</p>
<ul>
<li>Tape </li>
<li>A friend 🙂</li>
</ul>
<p>Instructions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Cut the top off of the plastic bottle using a knife or scissors. BE CAREFUL! 2) Blow up the balloon and tie it off. 3) Stick the straw through the hole in the cap and blow up the balloon until it is about the size of a grape. 4) Put the cap back on the bottle and tape it in place. 5) Have your friend hold onto the bottle while you punch a hole in the side of the balloon with a sharp object (knife, scissors, etc.). 6) The air from inside the balloon will flow into the bottle and inflate it like a port machine! 7) To deflate, just pinch the balloon shut and let go of the bottle. The air will flow back out of the balloon and deflation will start. 8) Be sure to keep an eye on your machine while it’s deflation so that it doesn’t get too small and burst!</li>

This guide will show you how to make a basic port machine using commonly available materials and tools.</p>
<p>The first step is to gather the necessary supplies. You will need a PVC pipe with a diameter of at least 2 inches, a PVC pipe end cap, a PVC elbow fitting, 4 hose clamps, 2 short screws, 2 washers, and a threaded rod with nuts and bolts.</p>
<p>The next step is to cut the PVC pipe. Cut the PVC pipe into two pieces: one piece that is 16 inches long and one piece that is 8 inches long.</p>
<p>Next, drill two holes in the end cap of the 16-inch piece of PVC pipe. The holes should be on opposite sides of the end cap and should be large enough for the threaded rod to fit through.</p>
<p>Next, attach the elbow fitting to one end of the 8-inch piece of PVC pipe. This will be the port that your wine will flow through.</p>
<p>Now, attach the other end of the 8-inch piece of PVC pipe to the end cap that has been drilled with holes.</p>
<p>Secure the hose clamps around both pieces of PVC pipe so that they are tightly attached. Make sure that there are no gaps between the PVC pipes and the end cap. If there are gaps, use more hose clamps to secure them tighter.</p>
<p>Next, screw in the short screws into each hole on the end cap so that they stick out about 1/4 inch from the surface of the cap. These screws will act as anchors for the washers and nuts later on.</p>
<p>Thread one nut onto each screw until it is tight against the washer. Leave these nuts loose for now.</p>
<p>Slide one bolt through each hole on the elbow fitting then slide a washer and nut over top of each bolt until it is tight against the fitting. Again, leave these nuts loose for now.</p>
<p>Now it’s time to assemble the port machine! Slide one bolt through each hole on one side of the elbow fitting then slide a nut over top of each bolt until it is tight against the fitting. Do not tighten these nuts yet!</p>
<p>Now do the same thing on the other side of the elbow fitting but use different bolts this time (the bolts should not be tightened yet). When both sides are done, all four bolts should be sticking out evenly from either side ofthe elbow fitting (two bolts per side). </p>
<p>  Now it’s time to tighten all four nuts so that everything is nice and secure! Use a wrench or socket set to do this job (you may need someone to help you hold everything together while you’re doing this). Once everything is tightened up, your port machine should look like this:</p>
