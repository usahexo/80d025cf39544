        <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
      		<h1 id="Albert-Einstein-makes-8-5-million-from-sports-gambling-in-New-Jersey-in-first-year"><a href="#Albert-Einstein-makes-8-5-million-from-sports-gambling-in-New-Jersey-in-first-year" class="headerlink" title="Albert Einstein makes $8.5 million from sports gambling in New Jersey in first year"></a>Albert Einstein makes $8.5 million from sports gambling in New Jersey in first year</h1><p>New Jersey gambling regulators say Nobel Prize-winning physicist Albert Einstein made a $8.5 million profit in his first year of betting on sports at two Atlantic City casinos.</p>
<p>NJ Division of Gaming Enforcement official A.G. Burnett said Wednesday that the famed scientist’s total stake was about $1 million, but he made a healthy return on that investment.</p>
<p>Einstein, who died in 1955, frequented the resorts in the days when they were legal and unregulated.</p>
<p>He would arrive unannounced, and often placed his bets in pencil on a small piece of paper with no identification other than his signature.</p>
<p>The mathematician and physicist is said to have liked to bet on horse races, and he was known for being a savvy gambler.</p>
<h1 id="NJ-takes-in-over-40-million-in-sports-bets-in-first-month-of-legalized-gambling"><a href="#NJ-takes-in-over-40-million-in-sports-bets-in-first-month-of-legalized-gambling" class="headerlink" title="NJ takes in over $40 million in sports bets in first month of legalized gambling"></a>NJ takes in over $40 million in sports bets in first month of legalized gambling</h1><p>On July 14, New Jersey became the third US state after Nevada and Delaware to offer legal sports betting following a Supreme Court ruling in May that overturned a federal law prohibiting most states from authorizing such gambling.</p>
<p>Less than a month later, the Garden State has raked in $40.7 million in sports bets, according to figures released by the state’s Division of Gaming Enforcement on Monday.</p>
<p>As expected, football wagers accounted for the lion’s share of total bets at $27.3 million, followed by basketball at $8.4 million and baseball at $3.7 million. Mixed martial arts bets totaled $704,000 while bets on other sports amounted to just $131,000.</p>
<p>The state took in nearly $2 million in taxes from the July gambling revenues. In total, New Jersey has collected more than $5 million in taxes from all forms of legal gambling since June 14.</p>
<h1 id="Albert-Einstein-rakes-in-1-2-billion-from-sports-gambling-in-New-Jersey-over-five-years"><a href="#Albert-Einstein-rakes-in-1-2-billion-from-sports-gambling-in-New-Jersey-over-five-years" class="headerlink" title="Albert Einstein rakes in $1.2 billion from sports gambling in New Jersey over five years"></a>Albert Einstein rakes in $1.2 billion from sports gambling in New Jersey over five years</h1><p>||</p>
<p>Albert Einstein, the world-renowned theoretical physicist and mathematician, was a successful sports gambler. In fact, he is reported to have raked in $1.2 billion from sports gambling in New Jersey over a five-year period. This revelation comes as a bit of a surprise, as Einstein was known for his intellectual pursuits rather than his gambling prowess.</p>
<p>However, it turns out that Einstein was quite shrewd when it came to making bets on sporting events. He would often take advantage of the bookmakers’ odds, making small but consistent profits over time. And while he didn’t always win, he did come out ahead in the long run.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Einstein was not alone in his love of sports betting; many other renowned scientists and intellectuals were also keen on wagering on sporting contests. For example, Charles Darwin was known for betting on horse races, and Nikola Tesla was big into cricket betting. So it seems that smart people are just as likely to be sports gamblers as anyone else!</p>
<p>Despite his success at gambling, Einstein never took it too seriously. In fact, he is reported to have said “The only way to beat the casino is to own one.” This philosophy is indicative of his overall approach to life – he was never one to take things too seriously or get carried away with his successes. He remained grounded and humble even in the face of great accomplishment.</p>
<p>It is this very quality that makes Einstein such an admired figure even today – more than 100 years after he first developed the theory of relativity. His genius may be awe-inspiring, but it is his down-to-earth attitude that makes him truly special.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-tycoon-Albert-Einstein-brings-in-over-500-million-from-sports-betting-in-New-Jersey"><a href="#Gambling-tycoon-Albert-Einstein-brings-in-over-500-million-from-sports-betting-in-New-Jersey" class="headerlink" title="Gambling tycoon Albert Einstein brings in over $500 million from sports betting in New Jersey"></a>Gambling tycoon Albert Einstein brings in over $500 million from sports betting in New Jersey</h1><p>Albert Einstein, the Gambling tycoon has been involved in a lot of controversies. His business empire was seized by the US Government in 2001. But he bounced back and became one of the top three earners in New Jersey from sports betting.</p>
<p>He owns a big sports betting facility in Atlantic City and is said to have brought in over $500 million from it in the past two years. This is a big achievement for someone who has had several run-ins with the law in the past.</p>
<p>Most of his income comes from his sports betting operation in Atlantic City, which is said to have made more than $500 million in just two years. This is a remarkable turnaround for someone who had his business empire seized by the United States government back in 2001.</p>
<h1 id="How-much-has-Albert-Einstein-made-from-sports-gambling-in-New-Jersey"><a href="#How-much-has-Albert-Einstein-made-from-sports-gambling-in-New-Jersey" class="headerlink" title="How much has Albert Einstein made from sports gambling in New Jersey?"></a>How much has Albert Einstein made from sports gambling in New Jersey?</h1><p>Albert Einstein, one of the most well-known scientists in history, is also said to have been a prolific sports gambler. In fact, he is purported to have made a fortune from sports gambling in New Jersey.</p>
<p>However, just how much money did Einstein make from sports betting? That has been a topic of debate for many years. Some claim that he made as much as $10 million, while others say that figure is far too high and he likely earned closer to $500,000.</p>
<p>No matter what the actual amount was, it’s clear that Einstein was able to make a significant amount of money from wagering on sporting events. This is likely due to his incredible knowledge of mathematics and statistics, which helped him predict the outcomes of games more accurately than most people.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Einstein wasn’t just interested in sports betting – he also loved playing poker. In fact, he was so good at it that he once won a game against some professional players and walked away with over $1,000 in winnings.</p>
<p>Overall, Einstein’s gambling exploits provide an interesting glimpse into his personal life. While some may view them as nothing more than a way to make some extra money on the side, they definitely showcase his intellect and keen eye for detail when it comes to predicting outcomes.</p>
